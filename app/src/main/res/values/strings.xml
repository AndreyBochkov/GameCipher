MEMORY. in 1885, hermann ebbinghaus studied his own memory. he wanted to know how quickly he forgot new information. he gave himself tests after different periods of time to see how much he forgot each time. the result is called the forgetting curve. we forget the fastest in the first 24 hours. and then we forget more and more but the speed slows down over time. after about six days, we have forgotten most of the new information. if we revise the information we make the memory stronger and we slow down the speed of forgetting. if we revise again and again, we can leave longer and longer periods of time between revisions. time is not the only thing that makes us forget something. if we are tired or under stress, we forget faster. if the information was difficult to understand we will forget it faster too. but things that are very important or meaningful to us are easier to remember.$$
FAIRIES. while most people no longer believe in fairies, only a hundred years ago some people were very willing to think they might exist. in 1917, 16-year-old elsie wright took two photos of her cousin, nine-year-old frances griffiths, sitting with fairies. some photography experts thought they were fake, while others weren\'t sure. but arthur conan doyle, the writer of the sherlock holmes detective stories, believed they were real. he published the original pictures, and three more the girls took for him, in a magazine called the strand, in 1920. the girls only admitted the photos were fake years later in 1983, created using pictures of dancers that elsie copied from a book. we owe many of our modern ideas about fairies to shakespeare and stories from the 18th and 19th centuries. although we can see the origins of fairies as far back as the ancient greeks, we can see similar creatures in many cultures. the earliest fairy-like creatures can be found in the greek idea that trees and rivers had spirits called dryads and nymphs. some people think these creatures were originally the gods of earlier, pagan religions that worshipped nature. they were replaced by the greek and roman gods, and then later by the christian god, and became smaller, less powerful figures as they lost importance.</string>
